        <h1>Keys</h1>
        <div>
            A key in a Database Management System (DBMS) is an attribute or set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row or tuple in a table or relation. Keys are essential to relational databases and are used to establish relationships between tables and columns. They also allow rows to be separated and used for calculations. There are different types of keys used in a database, such as: 
        </div>
        <div>
        <h3>Primary Key</h3>
            A primary key, as suggested by the name, is the main key used as the identifier in a database management system to uniquely identify each record in the database. The primary key has to have a unique value and not be NULL.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Candidae key</h3>
        A candidate key is a field or a combination of fields which can be used to uniquely identify the records in the database. One of the field present in the candidate key set is chosen as the primary key in the database. If none of the candidate keys are chosen as the primary key, then all of them are taken as the alternatte key.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Alternate Key</h3>
        An alternate key is the candidae key which is not chosen as the primary key for the database. In the case where there are more than two candidate keys, only one of them is chosen as the primary key even though the remaining candidate keys ( or the alternate keys ) can also uniquely identify the records of the database.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Foreign Key</h3>
        When two databases are combined together into a single databse, the primary key of one database is taken as the Foreign Key which is used in order to identify the records of that database in the newly fromed database. 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Super Key</h3>
                A super key is a combination of keys that act as an identifier for a database even if the uniqueness of the combination is not certain.
